            Question 1: Tell us the differences between uncontrolled and
            controlled components.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Answer: In React, a controlled component is a component that is
            controlled by React state, while an uncontrolled component is a
            component that maintains its own internal state. A controlled
            component receives its current value and an update callback via
            props, and the parent component manages the state of the component.
            When the user interacts with the component, the parent component
            updates the state, which in turn updates the component&apos;s value.
            An uncontrolled component, maintains its own internal state, and
            when the user interacts with the component, it updates its own
            state, which in turn updates the component&apos;s value.

          <h3>Question 2: How to validate React props using PropTypes</h3>
          <p>
            Answer: React PropTypes is a built-in feature that allows developers
            to specify the data type and shape of the props that a component
            receives. First, you need to import the PropTypes module from the
            prop-types package. Define your component and specify the propTypes
            property as an object containing the type and shape of the expected
            props. If a prop of the wrong type is passed to the component, React
            will log a warning in the console.{" "}

            Question 3: Tell us the difference between nodejs and express js.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Answer: Nodejs is a JavaScript runtime and express js is a framework
            of nodejs. Node.js provides a low-level API for handling network
            requests and I/O operations, whereas Express.js provides a
            higher-level, more structured framework for building web
            applications. Node.js is used to build various types of
            applications, including web applications, APIs, command-line tools,
            and desktop applications, while Express.js is mainly used for
            building web applications and APIs. Express.js provides a number of
            built-in features and middleware, such as session management, error
            handling, and request parsing, that simplify the development of web
            applications. Node.js provides only basic routing capabilities,
            while Express.js provides more advanced routing and middleware
            capabilities, which makes it easier to handle complex HTTP requests
            and responses.

            Question 4: What is a custom hook, and why will you create a custom
            hook?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Answer: A custom hook is a JavaScript reusable function whose name
            starts with &ldquo;use&rdquo; and that may call other built-in hooks
            like useState, useEffect etc. There are many advantages of using
            custom hooks in react: reusability, readability, testability etc. It
            is used to add special and unique feature to a react app. By using
            custom hook, developers get more flexibility.
